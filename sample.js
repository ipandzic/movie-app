When Lillian and Audrey book their biggest gig to date - at a hotel conference with an expected audience of three-hundred - the two commence what will surely be their most ambitious production to date. Over the course of their lengthy and emotionally fraught rehearsal process, two lifetimes' worth of personal, professional and creative compromises rise to the surface and the ensuing tensions threaten to derail both the production and their friendship.
